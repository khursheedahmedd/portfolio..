# Certifications Page Setup Guide

## Overview

The certifications page has been created with a modern, responsive design that showcases your professional certificates. The page includes filtering by category, smooth animations, and verification links.

## How to Add Your Certificates

### 1. Add Certificate Images

1. Place your certificate images in the `public/certificates/` directory
2. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `nextjs-cert.png`, `aws-solutions-architect.png`)
3. Recommended image format: PNG or JPG
4. Recommended size: 400x200 pixels or similar aspect ratio

### 2. Update Certificate Data

Edit the `constant/certificates.ts` file to add your actual certificates:

```typescript
{
  id: "your-cert-id",
  title: "Your Certificate Title",
  description: "Brief description of what this certification covers",
  image: "/certificates/your-cert-image.png", // Path to your image
  verifyUrl: "https://platform.com/verify/your-cert-id", // Actual verification URL
  platform: "Platform Name", // e.g., "Coursera", "AWS", "Microsoft"
  issueDate: "Month Year", // e.g., "December 2024"
  category: "web-development" // or "ai-ml", "cloud", "other"
}
```

### 3. Categories Available

- **web-development**: Frontend, backend, and full-stack development certificates
- **ai-ml**: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning certificates
- **cloud**: Cloud platforms, DevOps, and infrastructure certificates
- **other**: Any other professional certifications

### 4. Verification URLs

Make sure to update the `verifyUrl` field with actual verification links from the certification platforms. Common verification platforms include:

- Coursera: `https://coursera.org/verify/[certificate-id]`
- AWS: `https://aws.amazon.com/verification`
- Microsoft: `https://www.credly.com/org/microsoft/badge/[badge-id]`

  title: "AWS Solutions Architect Associate",
  description: "Certification demonstrating expertise in designing distributed systems on AWS, including compute, storage, networking, and security services.",
  image: "/certificates/aws-solutions-architect.png",
  verifyUrl: "https://aws.amazon.com/verification",
  platform: "Amazon Web Services",
  issueDate: "November 2024",
  category: "cloud"
}
```

## Navigation

The certifications page is automatically added to the main navigation menu. Users can access it via the "Certifications" link in the navbar.

## Testing

1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
2. Navigate to `/certifications` to view the page
3. Test the filtering functionality
4. Verify that all links work correctly
5. Test responsive design on different screen sizes

## Notes

- The page shows placeholder content until you add your actual certificates
- Certificate images are optional - the page will show a placeholder if no image is provided
- All verification URLs should open in a new tab for better user experience
- The page is fully integrated with your existing design system and animations
