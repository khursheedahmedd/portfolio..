KHURSHEED AHMED - PORTFOLIO INFORMATION

=== PERSONAL INFORMATION ===
Name: Khursheed Ahmed
Roles: Full Stack Web Developer, Generative AI Engineer, Agentic AI Engineer
Location: Pakistan
Portfolio Website: https://khursheed.online

Khursheed Ahmed grew up in a small village and began formal schooling in a government school. Early on he had modest ambitions, but encouragement from his elder brother (a software engineer) and friends changed his trajectory. He started programming in 2018 using Turbo C++ and developed a strong foundation in algorithms and system design. After initial attempts at higher education that included a brief enrollment in BS Computer Science and a later stint in Chartered Accountancy — where he passed multiple papers but failed one and re-enrolled in Software Engineering — Khursheed pivoted fully to software engineering and enrolled at UMT Lahore. Today, he sees himself as more than a developer — he's a problem solver, AI engineer, and entrepreneur who dreams of building impactful AI startups and contributing to global innovation. His story isn't about being lucky; it's about not giving up.

Technically, Khursheed is proficient in C++ (strong DSA background), JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, the MERN stack, Next.js, FastAPI and Flask. He has practical experience building full-stack products that integrate generative AI: automated grading systems, privacy tools for media, farming-assist GenAI, and agentic code-migration tools. He’s participated in international hackathons (IBM WatsonX, Google Gemma, Microsoft Imagine Cup, Meta Hacker Cup) and earned placements, demonstrating product-focused engineering under time pressure. Currently, he balances university studies, startup roles as a co-founder and CTO, freelance gigs, and personal projects aimed at turning hackathon prototypes into scalable products.

9. SupplyBox – AI-Powered Campus Recruitment Platform
Tech Stack: Next.js 14 (TypeScript), FastAPI, PostgreSQL, DuckDB, Prisma, Cohere, Groq LLM, Tailwind, NextAuth

Role: Full Stack & AI Engineer (Architecture + AI Integration)

SupplyBox is a large-scale AI-driven campus recruitment platform designed to connect universities, students, and employers through intelligent automation. The system consists of two major components: a Next.js main platform (werecruit-main) and a FastAPI-based RAG microservice (resume-rag), working together seamlessly to deliver a smooth, data-driven hiring experience.

The platform uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and AI-driven semantic search to help HR teams and universities find the right candidates instantly, process thousands of resumes, conduct automated interviews, and gain deep insights into hiring trends.

⚙️ Architecture Overview

SupplyBox follows a two-service architecture:

Frontend (werecruit-main): A full-featured Next.js 14.2.7 web application using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL. It handles user dashboards, campaign management, authentication, analytics, and report generation.

Backend (resume-rag): A FastAPI microservice responsible for all AI functionalities including embeddings, resume indexing, and semantic querying. It uses Cohere embeddings for vectorization and Groq LLM for intelligent query optimization.

Both services communicate through secure REST APIs, enabling modular scaling across Render, Railway, or Vercel environments.

💡 Core Features

AI-Powered Resume Screening:
Automatically parses and analyzes resumes using LlamaParse and stores vectorized representations for semantic search. Handles bulk uploads efficiently with async background processing.

Semantic Search Engine:
Lets HR teams find candidates using natural language queries such as “Find senior React developers with AWS experience.” The Groq LLM refines queries, while Cohere embeddings perform similarity search with transparent ranking explanations.

Advanced Rubric System:
Includes pre-built and customizable evaluation rubrics for different roles. The AI automatically scores and explains candidate evaluations using detailed per-criterion feedback.

AI Interview System:
Enables asynchronous voice and video interviews with AI-based scoring, cheating detection, and candidate personality insights.

Campus Analytics & Insights:
Provides data-driven insights into placement performance, skill gaps, and hiring trends across multiple universities.

Multi-Campus Management:
Supports universities with batch management, department-level organization, and multilingual support for global scalability.

🔄 Data Flow

Resume Upload → Parsed via LlamaParse → Vectorized with Cohere → Stored in DuckDB

Campaign Creation → HR selects rubric → Configures AI evaluation

Search Query → Enhanced by Groq → Vector search via RAG service

Results → Ranked and explained by AI → Displayed with analytics dashboard

🚀 Key Achievements

Built production-ready architecture with modular AI integration

Designed DuckDB vector store for local semantic search

Integrated Groq and Cohere APIs for hybrid RAG querying

Implemented NextAuth for multi-role authentication (HR, student, admin)

Created real-time analytics dashboards with interactive charts and filters

Fully deployable stack across Vercel + Render with optimized memory footprint

📈 Impact

SupplyBox drastically improves campus recruitment workflows by cutting down hiring time, automating resume screening, and ensuring data-backed decisions. For universities, it unlocks rich analytics and placement insights; for companies, it simplifies candidate discovery; and for students, it ensures fair and transparent evaluation.

The project demonstrates my ability to architect complex multi-service AI systems, optimize performance for production, and merge deep learning with modern web frameworks.



10. Snooker Vision – AI-Powered Snooker Automation System

Tech Stack: FastAPI, React (TypeScript + Vite), LangGraph, LangChain, OpenAI, ChromaDB, YOLO, Celery, Supabase, Redis, PostgreSQL

Role: Lead AI & Full Stack Engineer

Snooker Vision is a state-of-the-art AI and computer vision system that automates the monitoring, scoring, and management of snooker games. It integrates multi-agent AI workflows, computer vision, and club management features into one seamless platform, redefining how snooker clubs operate.

The platform captures real-time gameplay, identifies ball positions and movements, infers player actions, updates scores automatically, and even generates detailed insights and summaries — all powered by AI agents working together under a supervisor model.

🧠 Multi-Agent AI System

The system uses a 10-agent orchestrated workflow powered by LangGraph + LangChain:

Supervisor Agent – Central controller managing agent coordination and task routing

Calibration Agent – Table detection and homography setup

Detection Agent – Object detection via YOLO (balls, cues, pockets)

Tracking Agent – Multi-object tracking using ByteTrack/DeepSORT

Event Fusion Agent – Shot inference, foul detection, and pot events

Rules & Scoring Agent – Implements snooker’s full scoring logic

Session Manager Agent – Game session segmentation and time tracking

Billing Agent – Automated cost computation and invoice generation

Narration & Insights Agent – Generates natural language commentary and match summaries

Anomaly QA Agent – Diagnoses inconsistencies and responds to operator questions

The system’s RAG knowledge base supports natural language querying about rules, club policies, or scoring anomalies using ChromaDB + embeddings for semantic retrieval.

⚙️ Computer Vision & RAG Integration

Real-time ball detection, cue tracking, and event recognition

Homography-based table calibration

Detection of century breaks, drift, and foul events

Integration with RAG for querying snooker rules, historical data, or technical troubleshooting

💼 Business & Management Features

Full club management system (users, sessions, billing)

Multiple billing models (hourly, per-game, hybrid)

Automated invoices and real-time session monitoring

Financial analytics dashboards and performance charts

Natural language game summaries and insights

🖥️ Frontend & UX

Built using React + TypeScript + Vite, with Radix UI + Tailwind CSS for sleek design. Features include:

Dark/light themes

Interactive dashboards and charts (Recharts)

Game and financial analytics visualization

Secure authentication via Supabase Auth

Optimized API interactions with React Query

🚀 Impact

Snooker Vision transforms traditional snooker clubs into smart, automated environments. By combining real-time AI monitoring with data-driven analytics, it eliminates human error, improves player engagement, and provides club owners with unprecedented insights into operations and performance.
